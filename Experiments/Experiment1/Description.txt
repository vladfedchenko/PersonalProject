Experiment 1 - comparing the selection of columns by distance from uniform distribution with random selection (with spaces, no neighbor columns).

Steps:
1). For different column vector sizes (10, 20, ..., 80):
	I. Execute the algorithm of mapping creation (by calculating letter correlation with answer) 
	with randomly selected colunms for many times (10000+?)
	II. Find how the "distance to uniform" approach compares with random selection approach.
