Experiment 2 - compare low distance to uniform distrinution columns with high distance columns.

Steps: 
1). Calculate distance to uniform distribution for each columns.
2). Sort columns by this distance in ascending order. 
3). For different column vector sizes (10, 20, ..., 80):
	I. Execute the algorithm of mapping creation (by calculating letter correlation with answer)
	with columns obtained by using "sliding window" approach on sorted columns list and evaluate the accuracy of the mapping.
	II. Examine the accuracy by plotting it. (There should be a downward trend if lower distance to uniform 
	distribution is a good way to select columns)
