Experiment 2 - compare low distance to uniform distrinution columns with high distance columns.

Steps: 
1). Calculate distance to uniform distribution for each columns.
2). Sort columns by this distance in ascending order. 
3). For different column vector sizes (10, 20, ..., 80):
	I. Execute the algorithm of mapping creation (by calculating letter correlation with answer)
	with columns obtained by using the approach of selecting K columns with inreasing offset from the first of sorted columns.
	II. Examine the accuracy by plotting it. (There should be a downward trend if lower distance to uniform 
	distribution is a good way to select columns)
