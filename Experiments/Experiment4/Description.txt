Experiment 4 - explore the abbility to improve the accuracy of the initial solution.

Steps:
-obtain an initial solution by using described earlier approach (distance to uniform distribution, correlation of letters to the answer)
-try to improve the solution step by step (try to improve both the mapping and the column selection) by exproling neighbors in the solution graph.
-plot the improvements
